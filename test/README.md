### powerTill()
`powerTill()` is a function that uses the `till()` on sunflowers until a level 15 petal spawns. The idea behind this was to harvest only one sunflower at a time, to always have the maximum yield bonus. However, the function is not efficient enough to be used in a speedrun.
- produces ~120 power / second
- high seed cost
