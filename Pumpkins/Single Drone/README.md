# Single Drone Pumpkins
This is a collection of single drone pumpkin scripts that are used to farm pumpkins.

## Functions

### `oneshot.py`
This script is a one-shot script that will plant and harvest pumpkins in a single run. Uses water and fertilizer to accelerate growth.

### `schindler.py`
This script will keep planting pumpkins until every tile is filled. Uses a sophisticated approach with position tracking and selective fertilization.

### `tiny.py`
This script just runs and harvests at the same time. Simple approach that alternates between planting and harvesting as it moves.

## Benchmarks
Benchmarks with "-" have a less than 100% success rate and are therefore not able to compete in leaderboard runs.

### Benchmark Results
