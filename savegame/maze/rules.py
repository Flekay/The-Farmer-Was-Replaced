### DO'S
1. You can reset variables outside the timer.
2. You can preload functions and variables outside the timer.
3. You can print debug information outside the timer.
4. You can split the code into multiple files for better organization.
5. You can use your own `str`, `insort`, `sorted`, `median`, `average` functions.
	but they must be included in the submission.
	Consider making a pull request if your functions are faster than then ones in the `general` folder.
6. You don't have to use the example code, but it's recommended to use it as it is easy to use and understand.
7. You can edit your save file to speed up the process.
8. You can edit your save file to have infinite `Fertilizer` and `Sunflower/Power`

### DON'TS
1. You do not talk about the maze code.
2. You do NOT talk about the maze code.
3. The first action after the timer starts must be the `clear()` function.
4. The last action before the timer ends must be the `harvest()` function.
5. The time must have a precision of 4 digits; missing digits will be counted as 9's.
6. You must verify the collected gold (this can be done outside the timer).
7. You must use `get_time()` or `get_op_count()` for time measurement.
8. Your code must be public for verification.
9. Your file or folder must include all functions used in the maze.
10. You are only allowed to analyze the source code of mazes that are slower than yours.
11. Your submission must include the following: `minimum`, `maximum`, `median`, `average` and the number of runs.
12. The minimum number of runs in a submission is 100.
13. Do not cheat. Have fun! Good luck!
