## Benchmarks
| file          | items/min | note |

## popcarrot.py
I dont know why this only produces so few items, it should be able to produce 316k items/min.

## babymoehre.py
This script was originally designed for a 3x3 farm, but oddly enough it works better on a 10x10 farm. It plants only one carrot and then plants the companion and returns.
