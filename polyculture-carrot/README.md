## Benchmarks
| file          | items/min | note |
| ------------- | --------- | ---- |
| popcarrot.py  | 299k      |      |
| babymoehre.py | 187k      |      |

## popcarrot.py
I dont know why this only produces so few items, it should be able to produce 316k items/min.

## babymoehre.py
This script was originally designed for a 3x3 farm, but oddly enough it works better on a 10x10 farm. It plants only one carrot and then plants the companion and returns.

## cybercarrot.py WIP
@Cybotage please donate your scripts to the community.
not working yet. Should produce about 324.0k items/min.
