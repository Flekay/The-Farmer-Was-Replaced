## power-fart.py
This plants 7s sunflowers everywere. Then waters and harvests them.

## power-hash.py
This adds all sunflowers to single dictionary and then harvests 90% of them before planting new ones.

## power-path.py
This calculates the fastest path between sunflowers using nerest neighbour algorithm. This is about 5-10% faster than harvesting in planting order. You can test it yourself by uncommenting the "sub optimal pathing" part and commenting the "optimal pathing" part.

## power-runs.py
This replants directly after harvesting.

## power-spam.py
This just boringsly spams sunflowers without moving.
