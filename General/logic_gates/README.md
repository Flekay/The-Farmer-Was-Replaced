# Logic Gates

Logic gates are the basic building blocks of any digital system. Discoverd by @danielrab as a free way to save and compute data. This folder contains implementations of various logic gates in Python.

## Implemented Gates

- **true**: Output is always true
- **false**: Output is always false
- **And**: Output is true only if all inputs are true
- **Or**: Output is true if any input is true
- **Not**: Output is true if input is false

## Important Notes
- A recent update fixed dynamic functions to not be free anymore. This means that the use case for these gates is limited.
