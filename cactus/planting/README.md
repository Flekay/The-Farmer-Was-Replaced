# Planting Algorithms

This directory contains planting scripts used to grow cactus. These algorithms differ in complexity and include sorting mechanisms to manage cactus placement.

## Functions

### 1. `simple_planting.py`
A straightforward planting method that plants cactus without any extra sorting steps. It simply plants cactus in a grid pattern and measures each spot.

### 2. `plant_and_sort.py`
This algorithm not only plants cactus but also performs a two-round swapping procedure to sort the cactus based on their measurements. It takes into account measurements from multiple directions to ensure proper order.
