# Movement

This folder contains movement-related functions organized into three subfolders:

- [Loop Around](./loop_around/README.md): Path traversal that loops around the map, touching each tile only once.
- [Non-Wrapping Shortest Path](./non_wrapping_shortest_path/README.md): Shortest path calculations on a non-wrapping world.
- [Pathfinding](./pathfinding/README.md): General pathfinding algorithms and utilities.
- [Wrapping Shortest Path](./wrapping_shortest_path/README.md): Shortest path calculations on a wrapping world.

Refer to each subfolder for detailed information and available scripts.
