# Pathing Algorithms

This folder contains various pathfinding algorithm implementations.

## Functions

### `nearest-neighbor.py`
Implements the nearest neighbor algorithm for pathfinding. This algorithm selects the closest unvisited node to the current node and moves to it.

### `distance.py`
Contains functions for calculating the distance between two points on a 2D grid.

## Important Notes
- `nearest_neighbor.py` is probably the only relevant pathfinding algorithm since all other pathfinding algorithms require to much computational power to be useful in the context of this project.
